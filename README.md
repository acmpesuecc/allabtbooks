# AllAbtBooks

## End Goal:
- To create a mobile application to help users exchange books with others.
- To create a social platform where one can elevate their love for reading by
observing their friends, recommend books to their friends, host/participate in
events like book club discussions ...

## Why?

Libraries in India don’t have a large, diverse collection of books. If you are an
avid reader, buying books just to read it once doesn't make sense as it is very
expensive and reading e-books just isn’t the same as reading a physical book.
